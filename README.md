# Secrets API Integration Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was built to **practice API integration** using **Node.js, Express, Axios, and EJS**.  
The application interacts with the **Secrets API** to fetch and display secret messages along with the username of the person who shared them.

The main goal of this project is to understand how to:
- Work with third-party APIs
- Make HTTP requests using Axios
- Handle asynchronous operations
- Pass data from backend to frontend using EJS

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Axios**
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)**
- **HTML & CSS**
- **Body-Parser**

---

## 🚀 Features
- Fetches a **random secret** from an external API
- Displays the **secret message and username**
- Uses **server-side rendering** with EJS
- Serves static files from the `public` folder
- Handles API errors gracefully
